# About creation of this thing....

Since Eesti Gaas nor Eesti Energia nor Elektrilevi nor anyone is not giving simple way on
viewing how much and with what cost as well as calculated total was electricity used, I
decided to create this simple tool for such thing. Purely put of curiosity, nothing more.
There is little of value about such data to oneself but as a learning tool in software
development and above else the quriosity, this small child was created. Here we will explore
on hardships a novice software developer faced after graduading vocational school where he
got Junior Software Developer "degree". Almost zero knowledge, almost zero mentorship, all
on its own. Maybe its better that way... Anyway...

## First hardship...
### What do you mean width and height are not width and height?!
HTML attribute and CSS style are different thing apparently when there is exactly same word
used. HTML canvas element width and heigth attribute are totally different thing than CSS
style attribute width and height. Let look at this code snippet to get the grasp of what I
mean.

HTML

```
<canvas id="canvas" width="500" heigth="250"></canvas>
```

CSS

```javascript
#canvas {
    width: 500,
    heigth: 250
}
```

The width and height specified in HTML canvas element are attributes. Those numbers are IN
PIXELS! Can't set those to em, rm, or even %. Browser will ignore those and will just use 500
and 250 and they will be in pixels.
The width and height in CSS code, are the different kind of width and height. Canvas use two
systems: one for rendering aka internal size, one for rendering canvas (the container for 
rendering) itself. That means when you set only CSS style for canvas, the canvas container
will only be set, the canvas internal width and height will not be set. That has to be managed
somehow else - either use HTML attribute or create canvas element with all the needed computed
width and heights with javascript or use both.

## Second hardship...
### Hey Papa Parse!
PapaParse is nice library for reading .CSV files. It can be used server-side or it can be used
client-side. Well for starters the documentation on how to initalize for using PapaParse was
well, nonexistent. Offcourse you import it through HTML script tag either in head or in the body
part, both have pros and cons for that part. Offcourse you then just call it through its class 
calling:

```javascript
Papa.parse(file, {
    {
        // This all is default configuration options taken from PapaParse documentation
        delimiter: "",	// auto-detect
        newline: "",	// auto-detect
        quoteChar: '"',
        escapeChar: '"',
        header: false,
        transformHeader: undefined,
        dynamicTyping: false,
        preview: 0,
        encoding: "",
        worker: false,
        comments: false,
        step: undefined,
        complete: undefined,
        error: undefined,
        download: false,
        downloadRequestHeaders: undefined,
        downloadRequestBody: undefined,
        skipEmptyLines: false,
        chunk: undefined,
        chunkSize: undefined,
        fastMode: undefined,
        beforeFirstChunk: undefined,
        withCredentials: undefined,
        transform: undefined,
        delimitersToGuess: [',', '\t', '|', ';', Papa.RECORD_SEP, Papa.UNIT_SEP]
    }
});
```

e is not assigned: type error.
file is not assigned: argument1 error.
file is undefined: argument1 error.
file is this, file is that, file is none knows what...

There are various ways on how to get that damn file from the input.

First is:

HTML

```javascript
<input type="file" accept=".csv" required onChange="getFile(this)">
```

JavaScript

```javascript
function getFile(file) {
    Papa.Parse(file, {config});
}
```

Errors all the way...

Tried other ways also until I sumbled upon one nice solution:

HTML

```javascript
<input id="graph" type="file" accept=".csv" requiredÅ¡>
```

JavaScript

```javascript
const file = document.getElementById("csvFileInput").files[0];
Papa.Parse(file, {config});
```

Now it finnaly worked like a charm and altho there are many ways to retrieve file from
input, this one worked finnaly for whatever reason.

## Third hardship...
### What do you mean you cant set canvas size easily?!
Since I was not happy that initial canvas is only 500x250 px in size, I decided to increase its
width to maximum of its container size. But since my initial canvas was fully rendered in a function
where interpeter could not go until I pushed needed button, the canvas dimensions were set by
HTML attributes. Removed them, set the CSS style dimensions and nope, not gonna work... Not even when
set

CSS

```CSS
#canvas {
    width: inherit;
}
```
or

CSS

```CSS
#canvas {
    margin-left: 0px;
    margin-right: 0px;
}
```

Fixed it all by unfortunatelly moving setting canvas attributes from function scope to global scope
in javascript code. Why unfortunatelly? Because I was hoping I could get away with as less global
variables as possible initially.

## Fourth hardship...
### So SLOW!!!!

When you have a lot of datapoints and you have to iterate all of them through, you know it will take
some time to iterate through. And then you face the wall of waiting... Its already irritating when its
not snappy, its irritating when it takes couple of seconds, even worse when it takes even longer 
offcourse. I needed to draw a graph from roughly 700 datapoints. Its not much per se but it took around
1.7-2 seconds to itretare through and draw a graph from it. The graph was still incomplite so in the
process of making such file to have already 1.7-2 seconds of data reading and partial graph drawing, 
well its already too much and only on roughtly 700 datapoints.
Lets see what we can do first and the simpliest.

JavaScript

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    // do stuff
}
```

Whats wrong here? Perfectly working code realy. Perfectly fine code also! Its also very readable.
It is also not incorrect in any way realy since such code has its places all the time afterall.
So whats the problem here?
The problem is with reading the array length.
When you have big array and you have to read its lenght many times, lets say three times or more, its
better to read such array lenght once by asigning array lenght to a variable:

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const arrayLength = array.length;
for(let i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    // do stuff
}
```

Now its just a bit faster code! How much faster? In my very small data of 700 datapoints in array
and drawing just small strokes on a graph using for loop, instead of reading seven times array by
asigning array lenght to separate variable, gave me during small test very roughly 0.2 seconds of
time reduction on complite data reading and graph drawing. 0.2 seconds on just seven array lenght
readings that were moved to the separate variable.

## Fifth hardship!
### Comma is not a comma...
Remember those times when in floating numbers the comma means decimal points in those number? How
about a dot represents same thing? In real life depending on where you live, there is a possibility
that there are rules on what represents a floating point number on paper, lets say a math lesson.
I remember when floating points was acceptable to write down as 0,53 or 0.53, same thing on paper.
But not in CS or software development. So here we are, trying to use JavasScript built-in parseFloat()
function or Number.parseFloat() class function to parse a floating point number in its string
representation. The number was a string in a CSV file, so we need to convert it to a number. Easy right?
Not unless you remember that comma is not representing a decimal point in software development but 
dot does. So when you try to parse 0,53, you will get NaN. However parsing 0.53 will give you a floating
point number. 

JavaScript

```javascript
const number = "0,53";
parseFloat(number);
// Returns NaN
```

```javascript
const number = "0,53";
parseFloat(number.replace(",", "."));
// Returns 0.53, a number
```

Took some hours to figure out the problem but did not solve the next problem that came 
because of exact problem of NaN after trying to parse incorrectly floating point number in its string
representation. For some reason even after fixing parsing of floating point number, the NaN error did
not go away in SVG drawing circle. For some reason drawing circle on cy position still returned NaN
error. That brings us to the.......

## Sixth hardship...
### "Double or no deal..." - Home Alone 3, parrot talk
### Floating point parsing continues
After having troubles with already parsing floating point numbers using parseFloat() built-in 
JavaScript function, there were still some problems with NaN during drawing a graph in SVG.
Funny thing is JavaScript is very forgiving language on how you can work with numbers and strings.
Want to convert string to number? Lets say you have a string of 0,53. Multiply it by 1 and you get
number. Easy? Well such things eventually come and bite you hard! Just like it bit me...
Long before stumbling upon parseing problem I already worked with string represented numbers which
by the way were converted to numbers exactly because of such multiplication jokes while trying to
find the highest value or the lowest value without using built-in methods. Simple for loop, thats it.
Aparently when you evaluate numerical strings, the evaluation passes simply because that string-number
magic mumbo jumbo! Here is the code on how I found the highest consumption:

JavaScript

```javascript
let maxConsumption = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < CSV_File_Data_Length; i++) {
        if(CSV_File_Results[i][4] >= maxConsumption) {
            maxConsumption = CSV_File_Results[i][4];
        }
    }
```

As you can see maxConsumption variable is a number and we are evaluating strings to the number.
Since javascript is very flexible on such things, the string is internaly converted to number, evaluated
and then it all passes, no problem at all. There is no === evaluation possible when trying to see if
a number is higher or lower than. That means no >== or <== evaluations. That has to be done separately.
And that is where parsing bit me finnaly...

## Seventh hardship...
### I am getting used to it!
SVG is such great thing compared to Canvas that zooming page in or out scales perfectly the SVG
container albeit the internals are not scaled by itself. Canvas however did not automatically scale when
page is zoomed in or out... So... Its either rewrite Canvas to SVG since SVG is much more customizable
with CSS or do some flexbox etc magic. Better rewrite it to SVG, I like it more anyway after working
with both of them at the same time.

## Eighth hardship
### Redraw, redraw, redraw - why it takes so long to redraw?!
SVG is very powerful stuff but it comes with small negative side. When drawing something with SVG
you put a lot of stuff into DOM during drawing. When you redraw without clearing SVG container of
previously drawed stuff, it will take a lot and I mean a lot more time to draw stuff. And when it
does finish finnaly drawing, it draws stuff on top of previously drawn stuff because stuff was 
in DOM already when you add even more stuff to DOM. The simple fix is to just clear the previously
drawn stuff out before drawing new stuff. Simple fix for that is this small piece of code:

Javascript

```javascript
document.getElementById("SVG").innerHTML = "";
```

Apply it to whatever you need to clear inside SVG and you will improve drastically speed of redrawing
if you need to draw a lot of stuff. In my case, drawing just roughly 700 small lines with all the needed
x and y vector calculations took on average 3.8 seconds. Redrawing before clearing DOM took over 12 
seconds. Clearing DOM before redrawing, reduced redrawing speed back to 3.8 seconds. I clearly have to
find a way to increase SVG drawing speed because 3.8 seconds is still a lot of time to just do the 
calculations on 700 elements and then it takes a second-two to actually show what has been calculated
and drawn.
